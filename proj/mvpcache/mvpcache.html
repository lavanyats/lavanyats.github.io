<p>Existing caching strategies, in the storage domain, though well suited to exploit short range spatio-temporal patterns, are unable to leverage long­range motifs for improving hitrates. Motivated by this, we investigate novel Bayesian non­parametric modeling(BNP) 
techniques for count vectors, to capture long range correlations for cache preloading, by 
mining Block I/O traces. </p>

<p>Traces comprise of a sequence of memory accesses that can 
be aggregated into high dimensional sparse correlated count vector sequences. While there 
are several state of the art BNP algorithms for clustering and their temporal extensions for 
prediction, there has been no work on exploring these for correlated count vectors. We introduce 
the Sparse-Multivariate-Poisson and address 
this gap by proposing novel DP based mixture models of Multivariate 
Poisson and their temporal extensions exploiting the sparsity of data to design efficient 
inference algorithms.</p>

<p>We take the first step towards mining historical data, to capture 
long range patterns in storage traces for cache preloading. Experimentally, we show a 
dramatic improvement in hitrates on benchmark traces and lay the groundwork for further 
research in storage domain to reduce latencies using data mining techniques to capture long 
range motifs.</p>
